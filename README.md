## Project Overview

This project will be a community hub of sorts, for those interested in video games, and the different communities that surround them. 

Our objectives are to allow users to list some of their favorite games, partake in discussion, and find ways to meet with others who share their interests, whether online or offline. We also aim to list out competitive gaming events, for those who wish to travel and compete in the games they play.
