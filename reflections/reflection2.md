Pod Members: **Amber Lewis, James Bosch, Angelo Alvarado, Charidi Stevens**

## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 **We were able to resolve a pending issue with fetching data from a 3rd party API.**

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 **Persisting API issues**

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 **We have finished our MVP. Just need to style the website**

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 **Yes. We spoke with an instructor about our loading issue and we given good guidance on how to implement the changes in our code.**

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 **The stretch feature, unfortunately. Because of draw backs from the API, we lost alot of time to work on the tournament bracket api**
