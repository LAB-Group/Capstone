## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 #### We were able to present without an issue this week. No restarting the server. Everyone was able to present their points extraordinarily well.  ####

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 #### For some reason our edit profile page wasn't working. It wouldn't display the games a user would list. We also had an issue tryng to implement the tournament bracket stretch feature. ####

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 #### Our sprint goal for the week was to just continue with error checking and practice presenting. I would say we were able to complete all of our goals for this week. ####

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 #### Yes. We were able to practice presenting because of the example slides and spoke with our mentors on how to present. ####

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

#### None. We were able to utilize all of our user stories ####
