## Reflection Questions

#### Name at least one successful thing this week.

 - Getting the API to work

#### What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 - Getting the API implementation in our Events Details list

#### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 
 We did not. We were set back by a couple of days because of the API implementations. We were hoping to do more frontend styling after getting the event cards.
 

#### Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Yes. Especially projects 2 and 3 definitely prepared our team for the Capstone Project. We always go back to the backend of Project 3 and the frontend of project 2 and 3. Searching and requesting API's for our backend. Routes, models, and middleware.

#### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 Nothing at the moment
