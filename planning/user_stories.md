## User Personas

  - Kristie is a 23 year old teacher who lives in New York City. During the pandemic she has grown a fondness for video games and considers herself a gamer. Now that her interests in video games have grown and events are starting up, she wants to be part of a community of gamers to widen her interests. 
  - Fabian is a 20 year old who lives in Detroit. He is a student at a university. He has played many video games, and would love to find a community in his area that shares the same interests.

- Event Coodinator
  - James is a 30 year old who lives in New York City. He is a student at a local university and also works in IT. He enjoys the community that fighting games bring, and has hosted local events in the area for them. He would like to use an application to centralize this event hosting to see RSVPs and potential guests while also displaying information on which platform the event will play on, location, and possible venue fees.
  - Hector is a 25 year old who lives in San Antonio. He works at a local marketing company, and he is interested in making brackets for fighting game tournaments. He has never made one before, but would like to use a bracket maker that simplifies the creation process for him.
